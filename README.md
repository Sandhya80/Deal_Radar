# Deal Radar

**Never Miss a Deal Again!**  
Deal Radar is a robust Django-based web application that empowers users to track product prices across major e-commerce platforms and receive real-time alerts when deals are available. With a modern, responsive interface and automated background processing, Deal Radar ensures you never miss a price drop on your favorite products.

---

## üîÑ App Workflow Overview

1. **Add Products to Track:**  
   Add products by pasting a URL from a supported e-commerce site or by selecting from existing products in the database.

2. **Set Target Price:**  
   Specify a target price for each product. You‚Äôll be notified when the product reaches or drops below this price.

3. **Automated Price Tracking:**  
   The system regularly scrapes product pages using background Celery tasks to check for price changes.

4. **Receive Alerts:**  
   When a product‚Äôs price drops to or below your target, Deal Radar sends real-time alerts via email, WhatsApp, or SMS (based on your preferences).

5. **Dashboard & Management:**  
   View all tracked products, manage alerts, and see your savings and triggered alerts on a personalized dashboard.

6. **Subscription & Billing:**  
   Unlock premium features (like more frequent checks or additional notification channels) via Stripe-powered subscriptions.
